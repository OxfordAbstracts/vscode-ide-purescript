# Changelog

## 0.26.0

* Set default formatter to `purs-tidy`

* Add configuration for diagnostics on type (see below)

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.17.0`
  - Diagnostics on type courtesy of @wclr.
    - Work ongoing on this area, in particular compiler changes, but I've been running with this for probably months now and it's pretty cool even now.
  - Rebuilding on FFI file change (#181, @aranchelk)
    - This requires that the LSP client sends file changes for `.js` files now
  - Default formatter is now none, formatter options have changed  (#180, @andys8)
  - Detect new-style spago workspaces (#188, @f-f)
  - Update the textDocumentSync capability to spec v3 (#182, @dariooddenino)
  - Bundling changes (esmodules/build setup related, could potentially break something)

## 0.25.12


## 0.25.7

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.16.2`

## 0.25.6

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.16.1`

    - Fix formatting provider issue with multi-byte characters leading to mangled results

    - Fix code lenses stripping data constructor exports (#165) and add code lenses to toggle data constructor exports on/off. Tweak the text of these.

    - (Internal) Bundling changes to use esbuild

    - Filter code action by requested kind (#154) (possible but likely negligable minor performance improvement, possibility some language client might behave differently)

    - Initial goto-defintion for local symbols

      - This provides goto-definition only (so not finding references, for example) for some locally bound identifiers based on the parsed CST

      - Navigate to e.g. arguments of top-level declarations, let bindings and arguments to let-bound functions, bindings in do blocks

      - Known issues/future thoughts:
        - Goto-defn for top level declarations is still provided by `purs ide` typings, even though we could enable navigation to some more private declarations where type info is not available

        - Let block scoping is not technically correct as the scope boundaries created by pattern bindings are not respected

        - Some binders may be missing, eg record puns 

## 0.25.5

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.16.0`

  - Code lenses added:

    - Add declaration type signature code lens (Idea/initial implementation @i-am-the-slime, rewritten to source data differently)

      - Enabled via config: `purescript.declarationTypeCodeLens`

    - Add export management code lenses (@i-am-the-slime)
      - This features both code lenses on individual declarations, to add/remove from exports appropriately, and a module-level code lens
        to enable explicit exports if the module has implicit ones.

      - Enabled via config: `purescript.exportsCodeLense`

  - Other changes:

    - (Internal) CST parsing shared between multiple features, currently executed on document change

    - Add progress report on full build / server start

## 0.25.4

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.8` 

  - Default `purescript.addSpagoSources` true (already true in vscode default for some time).

  - Report incomplete results properly (fixes #144)

  - Indicate imported module on qualifier suggestions

  - Use new proposed suggestion API to give module/type info

    (at least in vscode for now)

  - Provide folding ranges for declarations

  - Only suggest to import constructor when type has same name (@i-am-the-slime)

  - Support qualifiers in import/typo codeactions as per suggestions. Fix #143

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.7` 

  - Show build error output when no JSON found. Fix #150

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.6` 

- Filter completion suggestions based on already imported identifiers.

  If a given identifier is imported, whether by an explicit or open import, only that same import should be suggested for that identifier.

  For example, if `length` is imported from `Data.Array`, a completion of `le` will suggest `length` from `Data.Array` but not `Data.String`; it will still however suggest `left` or `lengthOf`.

  Known issues:
    - Due to technical limitations data constructors are not filtered in this way
    - Depending on the `purescript.autocompleteLimit` setting, if the already imported identifier would not be in a longer list of suggestions,
    then no filtering of the other options will occur.

## 0.25.3

* Bad release version

## 0.25.2

* Adds an API for downstream extensions that want to interact with `ide-purescript.` More information can be found in README.md.

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.5`:

  - Add `purescript.fullBuildOnSave` setting which performs a full build via the configured build command instead of a IDE-server fast rebuild
    when files are saved. Disabled by default, may have bad interaction with "save all" type functionality, configuration may be subject to change
    in future.

  - Introduced CST-parser for some identifier lexing, fixing issues with identifiers (specifically operators) starting with `.` in particular (#146, https://github.com/nwolverson/vscode-ide-purescript/issues/184)

  - Fix #149 - autocomplete doesn't work when lines start with an "import" substring


## 0.25.1

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.4`:

  - Auto build of opened files is now behind a setting `purescript.buildOpenedFiles` and defaulted to `false`, this should be 
    considered experimental for the time being. There are 2 issues which become more likely to be triggered by this feature,
    firstly rebuilding (even unchanged) files can cause downstream modules to require rebuilding in an incremental build ([issue](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/4066)) and secondly there are reports that fast-rebuilding a file during a full/incremental build can cause corrupt output.

  - Formatting provider selection: Now `purescript.formatter` can be set to `purty` (the previous formatter and still the default),
    `purs-tidy` or `pose`. Requires these tools to be already installed

  - Internal changes that could avoid a case of the language server crashing abruptly

## 0.25.0

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.2`

  - The code action with kind `source.organizeImports` is now the action which applies all compiler suggestions
    for unused imports, `source.sortImports` is added (previously "Organize imports") to align with the changes for JS/TS
    languages in vscode 1.57. This can be used with `editor.codeActionsOnSave` or key-bound with `editor.action.sourceAction`.
  - Show a warning dialog (with build option) on start if we get an externs out of date error
  - Remove deprecated editor mode/polling purs ide config (Removed in 0.13.8)

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.1`

  - Add `flake.nix` and `shell.nix` to the list of files that indicate a PS project may be present #136, #137 (@ursi)
  - Change the way the `purty` formatter is spawned to make it faster
  - Don't fix implicit prelude in all (import) suggestions. #108
  - Add auto build of opened files #125 (@wclr)
  - Build with PureScript 0.14.x, CI udpates

# 0.24.0

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.0`

  - Add support for importing conflicting identifiers #118 (@i-am-the-slime)
